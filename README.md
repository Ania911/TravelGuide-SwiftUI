#### View:
#### GoogleMaps.swift - The view for google maps style.
#### GuideView.swift - The view for the information about places - location, detailed info, ets.
#### MapView.swift - The view for google maps in the tab bar.
#### TabBarButton.swift - The view for all  tab bar buttons. Each tab has they own view as well.

#### 1. Style.json - In this file I created my own view for google maps.
#### PodFile - The Podfile is a specification that describes the dependencies of the targets of one or more Xcode projects. 
#### Assets.xcassets - The all photo files for the project. 
#### For the design I used icon, logo -  the map of my country.
